# github_stories

I've been playing around with clojure on the train for the last couple of days,
and this is a small app I built. The app lists a repo's commit messages on a
page when you visit /stories/:user/:repo

Here's an example using one of my rubygems:
[stories/mockra/smeargle_](http://github-stories.herokuapp.com/stories/mockra/smeargle)

The app isn't unauthenticated, so be careful about hitting the rate limit for 
the Github API.
